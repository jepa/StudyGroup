This session covers the basics for working with git and github in R. 

**In this session you will learn how to;**

- Create new repositories
- Linking repositories and R-Stdio
- Issues
- Branches
- Web-page
- Solo and collaborative work flow

# Instructions

Please make sure you have covered all of the following steps *before* the session date. We will not spend time on these steps during the session and some of them are essential for it.

- **git.** *Essential.* Before starting this session make sure you have `git` installed on your computer. Here are some usefull ressources:

  - [git webpage](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), has a very straightforward way to install it.

  - [GitHub tuttorial](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) that includes a way to install it from the [gitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/). 

  - [Happy Git and GitHub for R users](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) is one of my particular favourites

- []() I like this short time video showing how to install it

-  **gitHub account.** *Essential.* You will need a [gitHub](https://github.com/) account. Note that if you get some cool [benefits](https://education.github.com/benefits) if you are a student or a teacher.

- **gitHub desktop.** *Optional.* It is not mandatory to have gitHub desktop but some people prefer to use it. You can do everything in R-Studio and github.com. In this session we will cover both the R-Studio/github.com bundle as well as the gitHub app. You can download the app [here](https://desktop.github.com/)

- **Updated R-studio.** *Optional.* It is always good to have an updated version of R and R-Studio. This session works fine with `R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) -- "Lost Library Book"` and the R-studio version `‘1.4.1106’ "Tiger Daylily"`. But remember that updates to *R* and R-Studio are always a pain!

# Keywords

- **Branches.** *Useful when you want to make mayor changes to the project*. Branches work as parallel versions of your project where you can switch, delete, include or modify documents without affecting the main version.

- **Commit.** *Do often! For example, after all major step in your work-flow.* Saves the changes you made to a document *in your computer*. Note that if two people make changes to the same document, there will be some conflicts that will need to be fix before you "pull".

- **Fork.** *You will fork everytime you want to collaborate with someone*. Forking basically means that you create your personal copy of a project. When modifying the project, you will have to "pull request" to merge your modification to the main project

- **Pull.** *Do it every time you open the project*. Every time you "pull", you update the project and incorporate any changes "pushed" to the branch.

- **Push.** *Do it at the end of each working session*. This is the process where you send your changes ("commits") to the project's hub and merge them to the branch you are working with. 

- **Version control**. *I like to think about it as a manual dropbox.* With version control, each time you save a change you are providing a time stamp, an explanation of the change, and identifying the person making the change. It allows for comparison, restoration, and merging of files.
