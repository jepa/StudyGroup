![The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of R coding](./Images/GoBaUg.png)



# Introduction to session

This session will look at best practices with *R* coding, or with coding in general. As a disclaimer, these are the practices I consider as "best or bad" after years of coding, and hours of suffering. Most of this practices were suggested to me by hi-level coders and I also did a survey on the slack channel of the *eco data science* group of UCSB. 

# Objectives

Get an idea of what are good practices to follow in order to have a cleaner analysis, inprove reproductibily and manage to not loose your mind while coding

# Instructions

1. **Session Matterials:** Get the workshop materials: Go to the repository and click on the "fork" button to create an independent copy within your own GitHub account. Alternately, click on the "clone or download" button. 

2. **Data:** No data needed for this session

3. **Necessary Packages:** There is no need for data nor packages for this session
